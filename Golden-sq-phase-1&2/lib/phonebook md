Phone Numbers Class Design Recipe
1. Describe the Problem

Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have.

As a user
So that I can keep track of my phone numbers
I want to keep a record of al numbers I use in my entries

2. Design the Class Interface

_Include the initializer and public methods with all parameters and return values.


class PhoneBook
  def initializer
  end

  def extract_numbers(text) #text is a string representing an entry
  end

  def list 
    #returns list of strings representing phone numbers
  end 
end
  

3. Create Examples as Tests

Make a list of examples of how the class will behave in different situations.

# EXAMPLE

# 1
phone_book = PhoneBook.new  #initializing
phone_book.list # => [] empty list() 
#use initialize and .list togther to check that the behaviour of the class is correct.


# 2
phone_book = PhoneBook.new  #initializing PhoneBook
phone_book.extract_numbers("078864545666")
phone_book.list # => ["078864545666"]


# 3
phone_book = PhoneBook.new  #initializing PhoneBook
phone_book.extract_numbers("I was calling my friend 078864545666 the other day")
phone_book.list # => ["078864545666"] # this is the should be extracted

# 4
phone_book = PhoneBook.new  #initializing PhoneBook
phone_book.extract_numbers("My faves: 078864545666, 07985736592 ")
phone_book.list # => ["078864545666", "07985736592"] # this should be extracted

# 5
phone_book = PhoneBook.new  #initializing PhoneBook
phone_book.extract_numbers("My faves:")
phone_book.list # => [] # this should be extracted

# 6 
phone_book = PhoneBook.new  #initializing PhoneBook
phone_book.extract_numbers("My friend Sarah is 078864545666")phone_book.extract_numbers("My friend Jo is 07985736592")
phone_book.list # => ["078864545666", 07985736592]# this should be extracted


# 7 - too few digits
phone_book = PhoneBook.new  #initializing PhoneBook
phone_book.extract_numbers("My friend Sarah is 78864545666")
phone_book.list # => []# this should be extracted

# 8 - no duplicates 
phone_book = PhoneBook.new  #initializing PhoneBook
phone_book.extract_numbers("My friend Sarah is 078864545666")phone_book.extract_numbers("My pal Sarah is 078864545666")
phone_book.list # => ["078864545666"]# this should be extracted

Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go.
4. Implement the Behaviour

After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
